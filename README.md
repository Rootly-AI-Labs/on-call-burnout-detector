# On-call Burnout Detector

An application that detects signs of overwork in incident responders by analyzing operational, behavioral signals, and self-reported data. It integrates with Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, and Slack to compute a per-responder risk score highlighting potential burnout trends.

There are two ways to run the On-call Burnout Detector:
* By self-hosting the app using our [quick start](#-quick-start) guide
* By using a hosted version [www.oncallburnout.com](https://www.oncallburnout.com/)

The On-call Burnout Detector measures and tracks signals over time that may indicate someone is at risk; it isn’t a medical tool and doesn’t diagnose burnout.

## ✨ Features

- **👥 Multi Layer Signals**: Individual and team-level insights
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Visual  and AI-powered burnout risk analysis
- **📈 Real-time Analysis**: Progress tracking during data processing
- **🔄 Tailor to Your organization**: Ability to customize tool integration and signal weights

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Docker Compose
The easiest way is to get started is with our [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/On-Call-Burnout-Detector/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).
```docker compose up -d```

### Environment Variables
⚠️ For login purpose, you **must** get OAuth tokens for Google or GitHub OAuth and set then in the `.env` file. Start with:
```cp backend/.env.example backend/.env```

<details>
<summary><b>Instruction to get token for Google Auth</b></summary>

1. **Enable [Google People API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/people.googleapis.com)**
	2. **Visit [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**
	* Create a new project (or select existing)
	* Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
	* Callback URL**: http://localhost:8000/auth/github/callback
	3. **Fill out the variable `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `backend/.env` file**
4. **Restart backend:**

<details>
<summary><b>Instruction to get token for GitHub Auth</b></summary>

1. **Visit [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)**
	*  Click **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**
	* **Application name**: On-Call Burnout Detector
	- **Homepage URL**: http://localhost:3000
	- **Authorization callback URL**: http://localhost:8000/auth/github/callback
2. **Create the app:**
	* Click **Register application**
	* You'll see your **Client ID**
	* Click **Generate a new client secret** to get your **Client Secret**
3. **Add to `backend/.env:`**
4. **Restart backend:**

### Manual setup
<details><summary>You can also set it up manually, but this method isn't activelly supported.</summary>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Rootly or PagerDuty API token

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run the server
python -m app.main
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📊 Signals Analysis

The On-call Burnout Detector (OCB) takes inspiration from the [Copenhagen Burnout Inventory](https://nfa.dk/media/hl5nbers/cbi-first-edition.pdf) (CBI), a scientifically validated approach to measuring burnout risk in professional settings. The Burnout Detector isn’t a medical tool and doesn’t provide a diagnosis; it is designed to help identify patterns and trends that may suggest overwork.

### Methodology
Our implementation uses the two core OCB dimensions:

1. **Personal Burnout**
   - Physical and psychological fatigue from workload
   - Work-life boundary violations (after-hours/weekend work)
   - Temporal stress patterns and recovery time deficits

2. **Work-Related Burnout** 
   - Fatigue specifically tied to work processes
   - Response time pressure and incident load
   - Team collaboration stress and communication quality

## 🔐 Security

- OAuth with Google/GitHub (no password storage)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Encrypted API token storage
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
