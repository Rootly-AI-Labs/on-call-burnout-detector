# On-call Burnout Detector

Detects potential signs of overwork in incident responders which could lead to burnout. To compute a per-responder risk score, it integrates with Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, and Slack.

Two ways to get started:
* Use our hosted version [www.oncallburnout.com](https://www.oncallburnout.com/) (contains mock data if you just want to test it out)
* Host it [locally](#Installation)

## Installation
Use our Docker Compose file.
```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/on-call-burnout-detector
cd on-call-burnout-detector

# Launch with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables
⚠️ For login purposes, you **must** configure OAuth tokens for Google OR GitHub OAuth:
```
# Create a copy of the .env file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

<details>

### Manual setup
<details><summary>You can also set it up manually, but this method isn't actively supported.</summary>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Rootly or PagerDuty API token

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run the server
python -m app.main
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

- ** Interactive Dashboard**: Visual  and AI-powered burnout risk analysis
- ** Real-time Analysis**: Progress tracking during data processing
- ** Tailor to Your organization**: Ability to customize tool integration and signal weights

##  Methodology

The On-call Burnout Detector (OCB) takes inspiration from the [Copenhagen Burnout Inventory](https://nfa.dk/media/hl5nbers/cbi-first-edition.pdf) (CBI), a scientifically validated approach to measuring burnout risk in professional settings. The Burnout Detector isn’t a medical tool and doesn’t provide a diagnosis; it is designed to help identify patterns and trends that may suggest overwork.

### Methodology breakdown
Our implementation uses the two core dimensions:

1. **Personal Burnout**
   - Physical and psychological fatigue from workload
   - Work-life boundary violations (after-hours/weekend work)
   - Temporal stress patterns and recovery time deficits

2. **Work-Related Burnout** 
   - Fatigue specifically tied to work processes
   - Response time, pressure, and incident load
   - Team collaboration, stress, and communication quality

## 🔐 Security

- OAuth with Google/GitHub (no password storage)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Encrypted API token storage
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
