# On-call Burnout Detector

Detects potential signs of overwork in incident responders, which could lead to burnout. To compute a per-responder risk score, it integrates with Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, and Slack.

Two ways to get started:
* Use our hosted version [www.oncallburnout.com](https://www.oncallburnout.com/) (contains mock data to easily test it out)
* Host it [locally](#Installation)

## Installation
Use our Docker Compose file.
```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Rootly-AI-Labs/on-call-burnout-detector
cd on-call-burnout-detector

# Launch with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables
⚠️ For login purposes, you **must** configure OAuth tokens for Google OR GitHub OAuth:
```

##  Features

- **Multi Layer Signals**: Individual and team-level insights
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual and AI-powered burnout risk analysis
- **Tailor to Your organization**: Customize tool integration and signal weights

##  Methodology

The On-call Burnout Detector takes inspiration from the [Copenhagen Burnout Inventory](https://nfa.dk/media/hl5nbers/cbi-first-edition.pdf) (CBI), a scientifically validated approach to measuring burnout risk in professional settings. The Burnout Detector isn’t a medical tool and doesn’t provide a diagnosis; it is designed to help identify patterns and trends that may suggest overwork.

### Methodology breakdown
Our implementation uses the two core dimensions:

1. **Personal Burnout**
   - Physical and psychological fatigue from workload
   - Work-life boundary violations (after-hours/weekend work)
   - Temporal stress patterns and recovery time deficits

2. **Work-Related Burnout** 
   - Fatigue specifically tied to work processes
   - Response time, pressure, and incident load
   - Team collaboration, stress, and communication quality

## 🔐 Security

- OAuth with Google/GitHub (no password storage)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Encrypted API token storage
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
